## 🪄 Usage

### Basic Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```console
python download.py # python3 download.py
```

### Single Video Download
Enter a single YouTube URL when prompted:
```
Enter YouTube URL(s): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhb8ghB8lMg
```

**For single videos, the script automatically optimizes the process by:**
- ✨ Skipping the concurrent downloads prompt (not needed for single videos)
- 🎯 Using streamlined single-threaded processing
- 📁 Direct file placement in your chosen directory

### Multiple Videos Download 🆕
You can download multiple videos simultaneously by entering URLs in various formats. The script intelligently parses different input methods:

#### **Method 1: Comma-Separated URLs**
```
Enter YouTube URL(s): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhb8ghB8lMg, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiCUh_V7Tjg, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcioaU54p08
```

#### **Method 2: Space-Separated URLs**
```
Enter YouTube URL(s): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhb8ghB8lMg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiCUh_V7Tjg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcioaU54p08
```

#### **Method 3: Mixed Format**
You can combine commas and spaces in any way:
```
Enter YouTube URL(s): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhb8ghB8lMg, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiCUh_V7Tjg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcioaU54p08, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghi789
```

#### **Method 4: Multi-Line Input**
For easier management of many URLs, press **Enter** without typing anything when prompted, then enter one URL per line:

```
Enter YouTube URL(s): [Press Enter here]
📝 Multi-line mode activated!
💡 Enter one URL per line, press Enter twice when finished:
   URL 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhb8ghB8lMg
   URL 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiCUh_V7Tjg
   URL 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcioaU54p08
   URL 4: [Press Enter here to finish]
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

You can modify the following in the script:
- Video format preferences (currently limited to 1080p max)
- Maximum concurrent downloads (1-5 workers, automatically applied only for multiple videos)
- Output directory structure
- Post-processing options
- Retry attempts for failed downloads

## 🧹 Optional: Clean Up Incomplete Downloads

If you ever experience interrupted downloads (e.g., due to network issues or stopping the script), you may find leftover `.part` or `.ytdl` files in your `downloads/` folder. These are incomplete files and can be safely removed.

A utility script, `cleanup_downloads.py`, is included to help you quickly clean up these incomplete files:

```bash
python cleanup_downloads.py
```

This will scan your `downloads/` directory and remove any partial or temporary files, leaving only your completed videos and audio files. Most users will not need this, but it's handy for keeping your downloads folder tidy after interruptions.
